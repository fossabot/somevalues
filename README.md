The Political Hexedekeract is a political quiz that gives different scores on 16 spectrums based on agreements and disagreements with statements.
It has been heavily inspired by [Politiscales](https://www.politiscales.net/), [8values](https://8values.github.io/), [9axes](https://9axes.github.io/) and other quizzes.
